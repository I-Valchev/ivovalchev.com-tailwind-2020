decisions in a business landscape. It develops a broad view of IT, beyond the narrow day-to-day coding problems.</p>

<h3 class="mt-2">MSc • University of Kent, UK</h3>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-500">The joint degree introduced me to key areas where IT and business meet,
    such as marketing, new enterprise development and financial management. I am no financier or HR manager, but I can
    speak their language and empathise with their aspirations and fears.</p>

<h2 class="mt-8 text-2xl">System programming</h2>
<h3 class="mt-2">Professional qualification • Technological high school of electronic systems</h3>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-500">For 5 intense years of studying programming, I learned how to
    speak code as fluently as my mother tongue. This is where my curiosity for IT transformed into understanding
    and a bit of true love ❤️</p>
